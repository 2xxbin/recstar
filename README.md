## Getting started with development

RecStar is built with [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb).

See the [README of the project template](README-compose.md) for instructions on how to get started.

### Other recommended settings

1. Install the `Kotlin KDoc Formatter` plugin, and use the following settings:
   [![KDoc Formatter settings](readme_images/kdoc_settings.png)](readme_images/kdoc_settings.png)
2. Run `./gradlew addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook` once to add a pre-commit hook that will automatically format your
   code before committing.
3. If in string definition files (e.g. [StringsEnglish.kt](shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/string/StringEnglish.kt)), if
   the formatter of your Android Studio is always turning the wildcard imports into single imports, adjust the settings
   to allow wildcard imports on package `ui.string`.
